# file-crypt
A program to encrypt files, so they can be deleted without a possibility to restore the files

It is completely written in Java, GUI designed in WindowBuilder for Eclipse, IDE used is Eclipse Oxygen.2

How it works:
It encrypts a specific File with RSA Cipher and deletes the Encryption key afterwards, so restoring the File
from the NTFS-Index is completely useless.
